<h1>Work Day Scheduler</h1>

This is a work scheduler for the current day. It will store data entered by the user in each field after clicking the corresponding save button.
It uses localSorage to temporarily store data.
There are 3 time frames: Past, Present and Future. The color of each field will change depending on the current time. If it's past then it will be gray, present - red and future - green respectively.
At the top of the page, current date and time will be displayed.
